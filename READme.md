## Overview
This repository contains a series of technical notes to aid understanding of concepts in selected chapters of an Introduction to Statistics, Statistics I, or Business Statistics course. Otherwise, it serves as a dump of personal notes broadly in statistics.

While many business statistics textbooks emphasise use of Microsoft Excel for statistics, these teaching notes will include solutions in R and Python programming languages. In a world where data and its access continues to increase beyond the limits of Microsoft Excel sheets, students of statistics are encouraged to adopt programming languages in statistical analysis.

As much as possible, I have included equivalent R and Python code that compute the same statistical estimates as manually computing statistical estimates using formulas found in statistics textbooks.
