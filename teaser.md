## Teaser: Probability and Sampling 
A few teaser questions on probability and sampling.

1. What is the probability that you will be hit by a vehicle while crossing the road on any given day? 
2. What is the probability that you will be hit by a vehicle while crossing the road, if you sample long enough? If your answer is different from that of the preceding question, why do your answers make sense?
